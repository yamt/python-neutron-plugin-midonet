python-neutron-plugin-midonet
=============================

This is the downstream Midonet Neutron plugin.


How to Install
--------------

Run the following command to install the plugin in the system:

::

    $ sudo python ./setup.py


In ``neutron.conf``, set the core_plugin to:

::

    core_plugin = midonet.neutron.plugin.MidonetPluginV2


Tests
-----

You can run the unit tests with the following command.::

    $ ./run_tests.sh -f -V

``run_tests.sh`` installs its requirements to ``.venv`` on the initial run.
``-f`` forces a clean re-build of the virtual environment. If you just make
changes on the working tree without any change on the dependencies, you can
ignore ``-f`` switch.

``-V`` or ``--virtual-env`` is specified to use virtualenv and this should be
always turned on.


To know more detail about command options, please execute it with ``---help``.::

    $ ./run_tests.sh --help


Creating Packages
-----------------

Run the following command to generate both both the RPM and Debian packages 
with the provided version:
::

    $ ./package.sh some_version
